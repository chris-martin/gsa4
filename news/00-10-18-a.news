Added 24 non-Animated <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=snes&game=final_fantasy_5&type=sprites&level0=non-animated">Final Fantasy 5</a> sprites, each a different class (with Butz). I've been cought up in school, and won't be around as much. And Masa has been busy with a lot of stuff as well; it doesn't look like he'll ever have time. So in order to get the SNES section in gear, WildFire has joined the staff to help out. Don't worry, I'll still be back around December and Summer break.. as for Masa, the future doesn't look so good.
