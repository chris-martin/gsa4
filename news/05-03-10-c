I fixed up the timing on Jim's regular standing animation. And I totally redid his shooting animation.  Why am I thinking of the past? Because tomorow is GSA's 5th anniversary. Hard to beleive, but true. I'm super-proud of how big we've grown.  It makes me wonder what the site will be like in another 5...</center>
