<img align="left" src="snes/terranigma/sprites/animated/playable/Ark_attackstandard_east.gif" alt="*poke poke*">  What?  What happened to the Metal Slug obsession?  I'm still working on it.  I've had lots of things going on lately.  Family emergencies and whatnot, so, I haven't had a lot of time to just sit down and update anything.  Anywho, like the title says.  I wanna try and get a lot of the palette swaps for <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=snes&game=mega_man_x&type=sprites">Mega Man X</a>, seeing how other Mega Man sites don't find these important.  <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=snes&game=terranigma&type=sprites">Terranigma</a> is just a beautiful game all around, with wonderful sprites.

<p>Edit:  Added a few Breath of Fire 4 non-anis I had laying around for <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=psx&game=breath_of_fire_4&type=sprites&level0=non-animated&level1=ursula">Ursula</a>, as well as NPCs from the <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=psx&game=breath_of_fire_4&type=sprites&level0=non-animated&level1=npcdam">Dam</a>.
