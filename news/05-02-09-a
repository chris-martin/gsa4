<text> <img align="left" src="arcade/night_warriors/sprites/animated/playablea/Hsien-Ko_crouch.gif"> Redid all the sprites in the <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=arcade&game=vampire_savior&type=sprites&level0=animated&level1=playable">Vampire Savior</a> section, since Mozilla Firefox now displays gifs correctly (the old ones seemed to run a little slow).  Also, dabbling around in <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=arcade&game=night_warriors&type=sprites">Night Warriors</a>, and noticed that Hsien-Ko's animations (as well as her color palette) slightly differed from each game, so I posted them up too.  Feel free to take a look and compare.
