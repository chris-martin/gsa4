<text>I've run out of <i>clever news title</i> funds this year, but I've still got an update or two left in me. Today brings forth our first new review in a long time as well as our first bit of GameCube content, <i>ever</i>.  This Christmas, snuggle up with Prowler's review of <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=gamecube&game=super_smash_bros_melee&type=reviews&review=112">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>. Or spend some time with your family.  (Weirdos.)</text>
