<img align="left" src="computer/maple_story/sprites/animated/skills000-beginnersbasics/animation-skill-monsterrider-effect1.png">In a trend begun by Hologram both in animation type and sprite source, I now give you more <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=computer&game=maple_story&type=sprites">Maple Story</a> sprites, this time in the form of skill graphics. Added today were all of the animations, still frames and icons for the skill group <i>Beginner's Basics</i><br>
<br>
Also, as the skills all contain partial transparency, the animations are all in the animated PNG format. If you can't see the cool little animation here, you'll need to go find the Firefox 3 beta, or alternatively, Opera v9.5.
