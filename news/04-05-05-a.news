All these years, I thought the name of the series was "GEO"-mon.  *shrugs*  Shows how observant I am.  As it stands now, I should have some Darkstalkers sprites (Felicia) and some Street Fighter 2 sprites (Ryu and Guile) ready to go tomorrow.  Goemon will probably make another appearance as well, since the graphics are simply beautiful.
