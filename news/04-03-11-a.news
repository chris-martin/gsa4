<text>GSA turns four today. We had hoped to have our fourth layout working for our fourth anniversary, and we were very close. Real life stuff and plain human error has got the best of us and slowed the conversion down some. Though countless ninja hours have gone into GSA 4 thus far, it's only about 80% ready. We won't show it until it's fully finished and perfectly polished. That time draws nigh.</text>
