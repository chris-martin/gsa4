Animated and non-animated sprites from <a href="index2.php?category=sprites&system=arcade&letter=v">Vampire Savior and Vampire Savior 2</a>.  I'm too lazy to make multiple links, so you're just going to have to click a few times.  Send <a href="mailto:NES.Nemo@gmail.com">me</a> hate mail if you want and I will practice my delete button skills.  <br /><br />I'll try to update again when I get the chance..... may not be for a while. Again, send <a href="mailto:NES.Nemo@gmail.com">me</a> some hate mail if you hate me because of that.<br /><br /> Aaron keeps saying that he'll update GSA then doesn't.  Send <a href="mailto:party_metroid@yahoo.com">him</a> hate mail irregardless of your feelings on the matter.
