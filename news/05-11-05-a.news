<head>Oh my...</head><name>Nemo</name><text>I had <i>no idea</i> being a full time college student with two jobs (not counting working on this site) would be so time-consuming.  Just so everyone knows I still exist, I've added one sprite to <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=snes&game=breath_of_fire&type=sprites">Breath of Fire</a></text>.  I'll try to poke the other staffers with a stick to get them to update.  I'll see if I can also muster more time for updating, myself.</text>
