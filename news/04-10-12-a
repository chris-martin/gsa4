We've finished switching our site over to our new host, <a href="http://www.surpasshosting.com/">Surpass Hosting</a>, which should provide faster service and less downtime.  I'd hoped that it would be a flawless transition, but all-in-all, we could have done a lot worse (and have). Our forums aren't transfered over just yet, but we're working to get that going ASAP. In the meantime, check out our new affiliate: <a href="http://www.retrogamezone.co.uk">Retro Game Zone</a>.
