The site "represents the American spite for republicans, religion, and crappy video games". You may or may not share distaste for religion and republicans, but at the very least take a look at the <a href="http://www.projectblack.com/article.php?36.255">Game Flames</a> section.<br><br>

Also, GSA is looking for individuals to help with updates. Experience capturing sprites prefered, but not required. If you're a highly motivated person with a desire to help out the site, apply for a position by sending me an e-mail or Private Messaging me on the forums.  Lend a helping hand. Two, if you have them.</text>
