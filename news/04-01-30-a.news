<text>GSA will be undergoing some -you guessed it- changes. Booya, my code ninja has completed the core script. The rest of my elite forces are working on converting the goods. "Ok, Nemo. That sounds nice, but how does that affect me, the viewer?." It'll be good, good, very good news in the long run. *deep breath* Our fourth layout will feature improved navigational features for ease of browsing, will include a bandwidth-friendly, simplified layout resulting in quicker load times, and will provide the staff with a much easier means of adding content, allowing for beefier and more frequent updates. But wait, there's more! We'll also start archiving disc scans, box art and instruction manuals. As we spend many ninja hours working on the new GSA, we ask that you be patient. Be patient and expect great things in the horizon.</text>
