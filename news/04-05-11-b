<img align="left" src="snes/final_fantasy_6/sprites/animated/primary/Locke_walk_east.gif" alt="That's 'Treasure Hunter'">  Like the title implies.  I've found a lot of sections that only have non-animated sprites in them, or very few animated sprites (mostly in the SNES section), so I've gone through and tried to flesh out a few.  Larger updates this time around include <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=arcade&game=street_fighter_2&type=sprites">Street Fighter 2</a>, with mostly Ryu stuff (a little bit of Guile as well); <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=arcade&game=darkstalkers&type=sprites">Darkstalkers</a> with some new Felicia sprites (as well as a couple Raptor sprites thrown in).  Small sections that have been added to include <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=snes&game=earthworm_jim&type=sprites">Earthworm Jim</a>, <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=snes&game=final_fantasy_6&type=sprites">Final Fantasty 6</a>, and <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=snes&game=goof_troop&type=sprites">Goof Troop</a>.

<p>Cyborg 009 is progressing.  I'm trying to get as many of the androids as I can before I upload them.
