Today's sprites come from <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=computer&game=cave_story&type=sprites&level0=non-animated">Cave Story</a>, and they are a product of my own spriting efforts.  I've been playing this game over the past few days, and the gameplay is quite enjoyable.  <a href="http://agtp.romhack.net/doukutsu.html">Download it</a>, it's free.
