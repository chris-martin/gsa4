I doubt many reading this even know that I was on crutches again for 6 weeks after my second hip surgery, but anyway, I am no longer.  This is cause for celebration &mdash; in the form of sprite updates. All from Schnauzer, as usual, because he is a spriting powerhouse.  Like a <i>mitochondrion</i> of GSA.<br clear="all" />

A word on GSA's next rendition: To be honest, I haven't touched the code in far too long, mostly having been tied up in another project.  Hopefully once the workload there dies down, I can have something to report on this "GSA 5.0".  I'm ever-reminded of it by Aaron and Nemo's encouragement.<br />

I've been feeling like my power is growing and I'm waiting for the right moment to reveal ourselves to the Jedi.  We've been discussing great things... I hope I have the ability to construct this vision.
