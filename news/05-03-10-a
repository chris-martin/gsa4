<text>A huuuuge update for <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=gameboyadvance&game=pokemon_ruby_sapphire&type=sprites&level0=non-animated">Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire</a> from taarna23, including all front and back sprites, plus all front and back shiny sprites!  I dunno who has way too much time on their hands, her for ripping all these, or me for adding them all. =D
