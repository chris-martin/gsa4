<text>First off, there are a few <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=snes&game=bs_excitebike_bunbun_mario_battle_stadium&type=sprites&level0=animated">Mario Excitebike sprites</a> to look at.  Something tells me that few of you have ever even heard of this obscure Bandai Satellite game.<br><br>

Next thing, people keep asking me to move <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=nes&game=friday_the_13th">Friday the 13th</a> to the NES section, where it belongs. So, I went ahead and [finally] took care of that.  Let me know if there's anything else on the site that needs fixin' and I'll try to get around to it. I'll try <i>real</i> hard.<br><br>

Additionally, I got our extra domains to point to the site. If you want to type <a href="http://www.gamespritearchives.net">http://www.gamespritearchives.net</a> or <a href="http://www.gamespritearchives.com">http://www.gamespritearchives.com</a> into your address bar, it'll take you to the site now.  I don't know why you'd want to, though.<br><br>

Finally, we have a new affiliate: <a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/t165efolfn24986B8324368AC53" target="_blank" onmouseover="window.status='http://www.thinkgeek.com/';return true;" onmouseout="window.status=' ';return true;">Thinkgeek</a>. They have a wide variety of awesome geeky stuff including t-shirts, posters and misc. office supplies.  Check it out.  Buy some if you like what you see.<br><br>
