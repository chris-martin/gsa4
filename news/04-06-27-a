Non-animated sprites of <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=neogeo&game=metal_slug_2&type=sprites&level0=non-animated&level1=fio">Fio</a>, from Metal Slug 2.  Once again, Holo's life seems to be taking a nosedive downwards, so if I just kind of disappear altogether... it's because I'm dead.

<p>So I probably won't be DEAD... but there's a good possibility I shall be relocating apartments... by myself...  Sooo, if anyone is in the Joplin Missouri area and wants a roommate, gimme a buzz.  I'm not sure if I'm serious about that last part or not.  Go look at sprites!
