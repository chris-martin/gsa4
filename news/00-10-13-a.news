After a short break from spriting, I'm back in the swing of things. Added one non-animated sprite to <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=neogeo&game=garou_mark_of_the_wolves&type=sprites&level0=non-animated&level1=Logos">Garou: Mark of the Wolves</a> (one sprite, big whoop). Also added <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=neogeo&game=king_of_fighters_97">King of Fighters '97</a> to the list of games, with 11 animated, and 5 non-animated.<br><br>Also, added to the SNES section were 2 games, <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=snes&game=boogerman&type=sprites">Boogerman</a>, and <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=snes&game=battletoads_in_battlemaniacs&type=sprites">Battletoads in Battlemaniacs</a>. ^_^
