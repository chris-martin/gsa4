This is the motherload, folks. There's somewhere in the neighborhood of one thousand sprites from <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=snes&game=final_fantasy_6&type=sprites">Final Fantasy 6</a>, brought direct to you via the Schnauzer Delivery Van. This hefty delivery concludes the themed trio with this arival of... <i>Fantasy Update 3 of 3</i>.
