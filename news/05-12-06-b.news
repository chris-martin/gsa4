<text>I couldn't sleep, so I'll do a small update instead.  Background(s) for <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=arcade&game=street_fighter_alpha_3&type=backgrounds&level0=non-animatedbackgrounds&alone=SFA3_CodyStage.gif">Street Fighter Alpha 3</a> and <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=arcade&game=marvel_vs_capcom&type=backgrounds&level0=non-animatedbackgrounds">Marvel vs. Capcom</a>, captured by Nashrakh.  If anyone knows the name of the stage (or the character that goes with the stage) from Marvel vs. Capcom, please make a post in the <a href="http://www.gsarchives.net/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=9">Site Discussion</a> forum, letting us know the true deal and revealing your hardcore gaming knowledge.<br><br>I really hope it snows a lot and school gets cancelled so I can sleep in.</text>
