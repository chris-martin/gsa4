<img align="left" src="snes/secret_of_mana/sprites/animated/enemies/Zombie_walk_south.gif"> So what if Halloween is going to be over in 10 minutes... this is still a Halloween update!<br><br>I redid the <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=snes&game=secret_of_mana">Secret of Mana</a> section.  Re-captured all of the old sprites to remove shadows (which are not actually part of the sprite, but a seperate sprite underneath).  AND, since it's Halloween, I added MONSTERS!  Be prepared to see a lot more work done to the Secret of Mana page.
