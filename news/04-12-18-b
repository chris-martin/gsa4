Check please!" align="left">Of all things, it would seem that this, "PBN" guy has updated the site with something he said he'd do in <i>June</i>. It's very considerate of him to acknowledge his obligations once in a great while. So please, humor him by checking out the additions that HybridPainKiller has made for the <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=neogeopocket&game=match_of_the_millennium_snk_vs_capcom&type=sprites">Match of the Millennium: SNK vs. Capcom</a> section. He promises to update again real soon. Also, if you happen to come across any errors in the archive, <i>please</i> let one of our freindly staff know as soon as possible. We strive for accuracy.</text>
