Well, perhaps not quite. These are, again, from the <a href="http://www.gsarchives.net/index2.php?category=all&system=snes&game=bs_chrono_trigger_character_library&type=sprites&level0=non-animated">Bandai Satellaview Chrono Trigger Character Library</a>. There are some new character sprites added, as well as some enemies.
