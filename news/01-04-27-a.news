Then you get the power, then YOU get the sprites. Ah yeah, baby. We have returned and things're all squared away for the next 12 months. Everything is back, save for our lost Genesis Section. May it rest in peace. With that said, the GSA staff will do everything in our power to revive the section. Also,<strike> if </strike>when you visit our <a href="http://www.gsarchives.net/phpBB2/">forum</a>, you'll need to sign up again. You'll get all your old stats back. Enjoy!
