Oh, but what's this? It would seem that I put some of Cooldude's <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=nes&game=yoshi&type=sprites">Yoshi</a> sprites up on the site. Try not to get too excited about that, because I've also uploaded a few comics I made ages ago. So, go read some <a href="index2.php?category=all&page=media-comics">Copy n' Paste</a> you ungrateful bastards!
