I know how everyone hates a forum wipe, so I put in a few hours tonight and got the database restored, and PhpBB upgraded properly.  I had to prune it down to make it reasonably-sized... We're likely going to start pruning regularly now to keep the database size down.<br />

In other site maintenance news, Nemo has renewed gsarchives.net for 9 more years.  So... at least we don't have to worry about losing the domain again.
