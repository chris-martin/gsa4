<img align="left" src="snes/ganbare_goemon_3/sprites/animated/playable/Sasuke_walk_south.gif" alt="Sasuke... named after a car?">  I'd been trying to update GSA every day, but it looks like I fell short.  *hangs head in shame*  I was watching Cyborg 009 on DVD, and while my update was ready to go... I simply didn't upload it.  I've decided, however, to capture some sprites from Cyborg 009.  They should be up tomorrow.  For now, more sprites from <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=snes&game=ganbare_goemon_3">Ganbare Goemon 3</a>.  Sasuke gets added to the playable character list, and I'm working on getting Yae.  I'll probably do a few misc poses like them taking damage, some more weapons, a few enemies, and after that I'll probably move on to something else.  Street Fighter 2 and Cyborg 009 next time.
