<text>On my drive to work every day I pass a church that always has an amusing slogan on the sign outside their building.  This last week it said:<p align="center">FAITH & COURAGE<br /><img src="gameboy/balloon_kid/sprites/animated/Balloon1.gif" title="Love can take you higher" align="left"><img src="gameboy/balloon_kid/sprites/animated/Balloon1.gif" title="Love can take you higher" align="right">ARE LIKE A KITE<br />AN OPPOSING WIND<br />TAKES THEM HIGHER</p>I'm not sure, but I think today's game <a href="index2.php?category=sprites&system=gameboy&game=balloon_kid&type=sprites">Balloon Kid</a> might have something to do with flying.  Whatever the case, there's something to be learned from overcoming adversity.
