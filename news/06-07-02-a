Drill Milky Punch, everybody. <font size="-2"><i>Now with vitamin D.</i></font>

Also worth noting... during the month of <i>July</i> the <strong>Game Sprite Archives</strong> Update Crew Blue Team <font size="-2">(just made that name up)</font> will be challenging themselves to update the site at least once a day. Can we do it without the aid of <strong>HBD</strong>? Time will tell...
