We celebrate... with custom drawn sprites from our very own GSA community.

<br /><br />

Presenting submitted works from <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=custom&game=deadoralive&type=sprites&level0=non-animated">Deadoralive</a>, <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=custom&game=joshf&type=sprites&level0=non-animated">JoshF</a>, <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=custom&game=ktb&type=sprites&level0=non-animated&level1=viewtifuljoe">KTB</a> and one from <strong>The Death Knight</strong> (see above right).

<br /><br />

Stay tuned. Things are happening. I can't really talk about it, yet. <i>Things</i> are going on, though and you'll know when it hits.
