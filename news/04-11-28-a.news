It's been a while.  I didn't die or anything. I've just been real busy with school, work and <i>social life</i>. True story.  Anyhow, today's update threesome is a mix of <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=neogeo&game=metal_slug_5&type=sprites&level0=animated">Metal Slug 5</a>, <a href="http://www.gsarchives.net/index2.php?category=all&system=arcade&game=alien_vs_predator&type=sprites&level0=animated">Aliens Vs. Predator</a> and <a href="http://www.gsarchives.net/index2.php?category=all&system=arcade&game=cyberbots_full_metal_madness&type=sprites&level0=animated">Cyberbots: Full Metal Madness</a>.  I should be able to pick things up a lot more after Christmas and I'll see what I can do between now and then.</text>
