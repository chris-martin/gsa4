<img src="gameboyadvance/dragon_ball_gt_transformation/sprites/animated/songoku_ssj4_stance.gif" width="63" height="81" alt="MONKEY!" title="monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey" align="right" /> This is a newspost for three sprites from the GBA game <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=gameboyadvance&game=dragon_ball_gt_transformation&type=sprites&level0=animated">Dragon Ball GT Transformation</a>. Incidentally, I think I'm out of things to update for the site. If someone would like to you know, submit some stuff, or point out something that I can upload to the site, that would be nice. Otherwise, the next update will probably consist of like, the pinball from 3D Pinball which is included with Windows XP. Did you know that that game was developed by Maxis? Weird.
