Well... PBN beat me to the update for the 22nd, and seeing as it is now the 23rd, at least here, here's another update.<br>
Not much for you, but there are some more monsters to look at from <a href="http://www.gsarchives.net/index2.php?category=all&system=snes&game=bs_chrono_trigger_character_library&type=sprites&level0=non-animated">Bandai Satellaview Chrono Trigger Character Library</a>. Enjoy.
