My roommate and I had move across town, hence the sparce updates.  I blame the cats... and the fact we weren't suppose to have them in the apartment.  @_@

<p>  But now we're all moved and settled in, and it's high time I started working on the site again.  <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=arcade&game=street_fighter_2&type=sprites">Street Fighter 2</a> gains a few Ryu and Dhalsim sprites, and <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=arcade&game=street_fighter_alpha&type=sprites">Street Fighter Alpha</a> gets a few Ken and Dan sprites.  Until next time...,
