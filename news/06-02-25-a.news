Well, this semester I haven't had as much time as I would have liked for working on this site. In the immeadiate future, I can't say it looks like it'll get much better. However, feel free to check out <a href="http://www.frappr.com/gamespritearchives/">GSA's Frappr! page</a>.  It's kind of like a guestbook, only you can see a map of where everyone from GSA is from.
