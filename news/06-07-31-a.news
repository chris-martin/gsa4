<br /><br />

Well, we've updated the site every day this month, that's for darn sure.

<br /><br />

And in today's update, there are new character sprites from <a href="index2.php?category=sprites&system=psx&game=suikoden_2&type=sprites&level0=non-animated">Suikoden II</a>.  Rumor also has it that we're planning some kind of <a href="http://www.gsarchives.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=5192">Gaming Tournament</a>, but it's my policy not to comment on rumors and speculation.</text>
