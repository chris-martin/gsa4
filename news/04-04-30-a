After we had the GSA4 conversion done, I got restless.  I hadn't captured sprites in quite a while, so I decided to work on some of the older games that people usually don't bother to work on. <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=arcade&game=street_fighter_2&type=sprites">Street Fighter 2</a> and <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=arcade&game=street_fighter_2_champion_edition&type=sprites">Street Fighter 2 Champion Edition</a>.  Not a WHOLE lotta stuff, but I've got more sitting on the harddrive, waiting to be worked on.  Super Street Fighter 2 stuff tomorrow.
