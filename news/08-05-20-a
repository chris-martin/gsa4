Big update of <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=wii&game=super_smash_bros_brawl&type=sprites&level0=non-animated">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a> sprites from various menus and screens in the game. Also these are the first sprites for a Nintendo console since N64, which means we get to add a new system on the left. YAY!
