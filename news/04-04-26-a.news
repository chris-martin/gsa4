It might seem like a long time for the site to be down, but it feels just that much better to be back.  In a big team effort, we managed to redo 4 years of site in less than four months- and that is quite an accomplishment.<br><br>

I added lost content to no less than 25 game sections while going through the site. Of particular interest, <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=snes&game=super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> and <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=snes&game=teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_4_turtles_in_time&type=sprites">Turtles In Time</a> are pretty hot stuff.<br><br>

In a less grand fashion many SNES games got a small update- namely, Batman Forever, Batman Returns, Battletoads in Battlemaniacs, Bubsy 2, Chrono Trigger, Earthworm Jim 1 & 2, Final Fantasy 4, Gundam Wing, Mega  Man X, X2 & X3, Rudora  No Hihou, Super Mario Kart, Super Mario RPG and Zombies Ate My Neighbors.  The Neo*Geo section got some love in the form of Metal Slug, Metal Slug X, Top Hunter, Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer and Real Bout Fatal Fury.  Finally, Pac Man for NES as well as Space-Cadet's Custom Section have each grown ever so slightly.<br><br>

Be on the lookout for more updates real soon, especially from our mondo stockpile of submissions.</text>
