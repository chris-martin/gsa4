I've got LOTS of stuff worked up from all the other games (except Metal Slug 4, but that'll change), and I'm gonna try and get a lot of the stuff I have done up in the next few days.  I know I say that a lot, but I still gotta try.  I'll also be rearranging all the Metal Slug sections, so a note to the staff... Holo is on his "organizational-warpath".  "Stayeth Away".  With that... I leave you a... uhh... some sprites.  Go look at 'em!

And I'm still waiting on Nemo's story about the killer monkey...
