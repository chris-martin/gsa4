I'm excited to present Minesweeper <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=computer&game=minesweeper">stuff</a>, which may or may not consist of buddy icons & non-animated sprites. I can't say.  I will say that I still rock at Minesweeper.  And it's still free after all these years [with purchase of an expensive operating system]. Free is free, right?</text>
