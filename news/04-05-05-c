<img align="left" src="nes/mike_tysons_punch_out/sprites/animated/hippotalk.gif" alt="I'm a fatty.">They said that they'd hit me unless I updated the site... So, anyways, I went ahead and put some of Penguinato's sprites on the site. There's a <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=nes&game=mike_tysons_punch_out&type=sprites&level0=animated">Mike Tyson's Punch Out!!</a> sprite, a <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=snes&game=king_of_monsters_2&type=sprites&level0=animated">King of Monsters 2</a> sprite, and some <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=gameboyadvance&game=mega_man_zero_2&type=sprites&level0=animated">Mega Man Zero 2</a> sprites in there. Be sure to tell me if there's an error in there. Now that I've learned how to update, I can get to the REAL duties of a staffer, ignoring the <a href="phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=2">Submission Board</a>. Rejoice, you bastards!
