So, uh... how are things? I'm doing well, thanks. <br /><br />

Anyway, I've got some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oXx0qwe0wc">nice things on sale, stranger</a>. More specifically icon-like things from <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=computer&game=warcraft_3&type=sprites&level0=non-animated">WarCraft III</a>. Well, they're not really for sale but they are nice things, stranger. I'd buy 'em at a high price.<br /><br />

The icons were submitted by K-ToF but GoblinLord also did a lot of work organizing them for me, since I've never played WarCraft III. Unfortunately, our system has no way to credit two different people so I'm mentioning it here, instead.
