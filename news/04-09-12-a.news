Sha-zam! Sprites from <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=gameboyadvance&game=warioware_inc_mega_microgames&type=sprites&level0=animated">WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$</a>.  Fun, fun, super-fun game.  If you haven't played it, you simply must. There's even two player games that you can play with ONE GameBoy Advance.  WarioWare is crazy stuff, ladies and gents... crazy stuff.</text>
