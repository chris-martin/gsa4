I nearly died on my drive to church yesterday morning.

<br /><br />

I was driving in a curvey 35 miles-per-hour area going about 50 miles-per-hour in the rain while trying to clean off the drive stick which was sticky. When I looked up from my cleaning, I noticed I was about to go off the road a bit, so I swerved left. I swerved a bit too fast, however as I started to slide left.  I'm pretty certain my Automatic Brake System (ABS) kicked in and started to auto-adjust, so when I swerved right to correct, so did my ABS system. I was swerving right, then over-corrected left, then went right again, this time spinning 180&deg; off the side of the road. When I had stopped, I was pleased I hadn't gone off the left side of the road into trees or into the telephone poles on the right side of the road. Glad that I hadn't gone to be with God, I decided to put on my seat belt and continue driving to church, where I could go to be with God.  Ironically, the first verse we read in our Bible study was Isaiah 30:21- <i>Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, "This is the way; walk in it."</i>

<br /><br />

From my experiences, I conclude God prevented my stupidity from killing me so that I can do... <i>something...</i> something totally sweet. I'm not sure what yet. I certainly have something to look forward to.

I added a few of the <strong>Monster World 3</strong> <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=genesis&game=monster_world_3&type=sprites&level0=non-animated">sprites</a> submitted by Lag.

Will there be another update tomorrow? As you gaze into the <strong>Magic 8-Ball</strong>, you find that the answer is: Don't count on it.</strong>
