I promise, it won't happen again." src="nes/mega_man_4/sprites/animated/FinalBoss_Dr.Willy_Lose.gif"><a href="index2.php?category=all&system=nes&game=mega_man_4">Mega Man 4</a>: bumloads of Sprites and Backgrounds.  I couldn't figure out the proper names of the enemies, other bosses or the "friend". There's hundreds of Mega Man sites on the net and NONE of them that I went to had the info I was looking for. There must be some hardcore site out there. If anyone out there is a Mega Man sleth and can figure out some or all of the names, I'll give you a big high-five. You can either post your findings on <a href="http://www.gsarchives.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=3788">this forum topic</a> or e-mail me.
