<img align="left" src="nds/world_ends_with_you/sprites/non-animated/pins/228-RedSkull.png">Finally, an update! It's been far too long, I'm really going to have to try to do this more often. Today brings pins from the DS game <a href="http://www.gsarchives.net/index2.php?category=all&system=nds&game=world_ends_with_you&type=sprites&level0=non-animated&level1=pins"><i>The World Ends with You</i></a>. All 304 of them. Insanity.<br>
<br>
On a side note, I'm also working on a related project of reworking the graphics from the pins and making real pins out of them, if you're interested, <a href="http://worldsendpinshop.tk" target="blank">check it out</a>. If you like my designs, show some support and buy a few of the pins! ;)
