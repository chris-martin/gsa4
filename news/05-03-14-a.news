Today we have some computer sprites and a background from <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=computer&game=crystal_caves">Crystal Caves</a>, as well as some sprites from <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=nes&game=a_boy_and_his_blob&type=sprites">A Boy and His Blob</a>, courtesy of <a href="phpBB2/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&u=75">Schnauzer</a>, just to tide you over until my next (larger) update.
