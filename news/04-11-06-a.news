<img src="nes/battletoads/sprites/animated/playable/Zitz_run.gif" align="left" alt="Frog LAYGZ!"> Yeah, it's that time of the month to update, or so it seems.  What's been distracting me from the site this time?  *pulls out big book of excuses*  Art.  Been working on a retelling of the Mario Bros story... basically what that awful movie SHOULD have been.  I'm not gonna go into detail on GSA, but if you wanna see more, by all means click <a href="http://hologramzx.deviantart.com/">here</a>.  Yes, I'm plugging my DeviantART account on the main page...

<p>Now for the sprite part of things.  <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=gameboyadvance&game=legend_of_zelda_the_minish_cap&type=sprites">Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap</a> sprites.  I'm working on breaking a lot of the sprites down, so not ALL of my stuff for that game is up yet.  <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=nes&game=flintstones_rescue_of_dino_and_hoppy&type=sprites">Flintstones: The Rescue of Dino and Hoppy</a>.  Everyone, start rolling your eyes now.  Last on the list, would be a small addition to <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=nes&game=battletoads&type=sprites">Battletoads</a>, for the original NES.  More stuff on the way, once I pull my nose outta my sketchbook.  >.<
