Old stuff I had layin' around from <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=arcade&game=marvel_vs_capcom&type=sprites">Marvel vs. Capcom</a>.  Right now, I'm just trying to integrate all my old stuff into the new layout.

<p>I've got a TON of Street Fighter content I'm going to add next, as well as Darkstalkers, Marvel Superheroes, and sprites from the Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.  Keep an eye out (now that updating is insanely easy).

<p>Edit: Went ahead and added some Blanka sprites from <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=arcade&game=street_fighter_alpha_3&type=sprites">Street Fighter Alpha 3</a>.  I wasn't kidding when I said updating was easy...
