Phew.  Re-arranged everything in these sections, renamed some stuff, transferred a few sprites to another section (there was a Cody sprite stuck in Street Fighter Alpha, when it should have been in Alpha 3.  It'll appear in Alpha 3 my next update.)  If time permits me to, I'm gonna try and work on some more Darkstalkers stuff.
