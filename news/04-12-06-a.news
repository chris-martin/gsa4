It's another update.  And how?  The answer to that rhetorical question is long and uninteresting so I'm not going to bore you with the details of my "exciting" life. Instead, I'm going to show you <a href="http://www.gsarchives.net/index2.php?category=all&system=neogeo&game=king_of_fighters_2001&type=sprites&level0=animated">3 sprites of Kula from King Of Fighters 2001</a>. Perhaps next time I have a small update, I'll make up a story about killer monkeys to spice things up a bit.</text>
