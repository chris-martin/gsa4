<img align="left" src="arcade/street_fighter_alpha_3/sprites/animated/playable/Balrog_walkforward.gif" alt="Gonna get'cher EAR!  Mike Tyson ear-jokes never get old, right?">  Right, worst title in the world.  Just a few sprites here and there.  Disassembling some of Joram's sprites from <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=dreamcast&game=street_fighter_3_third_strike&type=sprites&level0=non-animated">Street Fighter 3: Third Strike</a>.  I still have a good handful of new animated sprites I need to add from this game as well.  <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=arcade&game=street_fighter_alpha_3&type=sprites">Street Fighter Alpha 3</a> gets some new stuff, and I FINALLY added those <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=gameboyadvance&game=sonic_battle&type=sprites&level0=animated&level1=skillcards">Sonic Battle</a> sprites from Babybird that have been sitting in the submission forum for 6 months.

<p>And just a little sidenote:  If anyone has any Marvel vs Capcom 2 animated sprites and wants to submit them, I would forever be in your debt.  If not, I'm gonna have to start beggin' to the guys at Shoryuken.com.  *dreams of Amingo sprites*

<p>Edit:  Added some old stuff I had for <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=arcade&game=mortal_kombat_2&type=sprites&level0=animated">Mortal Kombat 2</a>, as well as <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=arcade&game=simpsons&type=sprites">The Simpsons</a>.
