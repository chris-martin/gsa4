Well, my semester of terror has finally ended. At least for the summer, I'll be updating more frequently.  That could mean once a month or once a week. I'm not going to promise anything since I'm lazy.<br /><br />

Speaking of being lazy, 1½ years ago Sora3087 submitted some nice <a href="index2.php?category=all&system=gameboyadvance&game=kingdom_hearts_chain_of_memories&type=sprites">Kingdom Hearts</a> sprites.  <br /><br />

<strong>Next update</strong>: Submissions from K-ToF.
